## Why am I Here?
1. Crypto is the future of finance. That makes it motivating to build in this space.
2. I believe in cryptography's power to decrease returns to violence, protecting us from negative-sum actors. I want to learn how to harness that defensive power, and make it easy to use for myself and others.
3. There's a lot of smart & cool people in crypto and I like meeting y'all.
