## Work
* Led a team of 3 to build a frontend for the FIAT Protocol. [Link](https://github.com/fiatdao/fiat-ui-i)
* Built a frontend for governing the FIAT protocol, including ve-token locking mechanics. [Private link](https://github.com/fiatdao/gov-ui-ii)

## Projects
* I author a newsletter called [Web3 Frontend Weekly](https://web3frontendweekly.substack.com/). I share high quality Typescript & React snippets, design advice, in-depth technical comparisons, and more to help you build a dApp better & faster than you thought possible.
* Other random things. DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xTARC) or Discord ([TARC#8659](969663184317345813)) and ask about them!

## Why am I Here?
1. Crypto is the future of finance. That makes it motivating to build in this space.
2. I believe in cryptography's power to decrease returns to violence, protecting us from negative-sum actors. I want to learn how to harness that defensive power, and make it easy to use for myself and others.
3. There's a lot of smart & cool people in crypto and I like meeting y'all.
