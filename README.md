## Why am I Here?
1. High quality financial services for all is a motivating future to build towards.
2. Crypto has the potential to greatly reduce the incentive to violence. This is because by default, no one knows how much crypto you own or how to access it. I want to live in a world with less violence, don't you?
3. There's a lot of smart & cool people in crypto and I like meeting y'all.
